# Lano Visualizer
A simple but highly configurable visualizer with rounded bars.

#### Minimum Requirements:
 - Windows Vista
 - Rainmeter 3.3 (4.0 Beta recommended)

#### Features

- Live visualization of the audio output
- Customizable colors and fonts
- Genre-based colors (AIMP, CAD, iTunes, WMP and Winamp)
- Support for all mayor media players
- Full Spotify support

#### Important notes


- You need at least Rainmeter 3.3 or higher to get all features of this skin. You can find the newest version on rainmeter.net
- After installation you can access the settings by right-clicking the skin and then clicking on Open Settings.
- Due to limitations of Rainmeter/the plugin used for the visualization the complete audio output of your system will be shown on the visualizer. For the best experience only play music. This is something I canâ€™t fix.
